I want an adaptation to stay true to the tone &amp; themes of the original. I also want it to add to the original in ways that are <b>only</b> possible in the form factor of the adaptation (a movie adaptation of a book should be more cinematic, a book adaptation of a movie should be more literary, a play adaptation of a novel should be more theatrical, etc etc etc for all permutations).</p><p>This adaptation was true to the tone of the book throughout, but it took till the last twenty minute to make me feel like it was doing something moving in a cinematic way that a book could never accomplish. Once it got there, it was spectacular.</p><p>I would have enjoyed the first half more if it had stuck to the non-linear narrative of the novel (you know I'm a sucker for non-linear narrative).</p><p>My short reviews usually do better on here (brevity is the soul of wit, after all) but sometime ya just have to rant.</p><p>P.S. for a recent adaptation that I think broke from the theme of the source material and it pissed me off see <a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/ncteisen/film/frankenstein-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">my review of Frankenstein<a rel=\"nofollow\">.</a></a></p>",

Haymitch was a fully three-dimensional character in the original trilogy, with a backstory and that was shown, not told, and understood through dialog and choices.<br /><br />This prequel was a cameo-jammed, overly retconned, unnecessary retelling of a story that packed a bigger punch in less than ten pages of <i>Catching Fire</i>.<br /><br />The only saving grace - even though I complained about it a sentence ago - is that each cameo did make me squeal \"omg I KNOW them.\"<br/>"
