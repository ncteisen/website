        "review": "<br/>Re-reading this post-pandy hits a lot harder. The chapters that describe the fallout from the flu went from being interesting sci-fi to fridge-horror what-ifs about the real pandemic.<br /><br />Such a solid work of literary-ish sci-fi. I could see someone criticizing this book for having an anti-climatic ending, but they would have missed the the fact that it was all about the journey.<br /><br />ORIGINAL 2017 REVIEW BELOW<br /><br />I'll always love a well executed, deeply intertwined, mosaic piece.<br /><br />Read this very shortly after reading The Road, and the astounding differences in tone were fun to think about.<br/>"

        "review": "<br/>Absolutely wonderful. I liked this significantly better than <i>The Overstory</i> and I already liked that one a lot. It took a little to get going, but once the characters and story were established it started to hum. Like his other books, this has themes of environmentalism, technology, friendship, love, and family. For a lot of other novels that would feel like too much, but Powers is so good at weaving themes and meanings into the narrative that it never felt like this was overreaching.<br /><br />I am a big fan of meta-review about \"cinematic moments\" I had sitting in movies theaters and \"literary moments\" I had reading something wherever I was reading it. Well, this gave me a big one as I stayed up to finish it alone in a ski lease in Tahoe. I am putting it up there with a few other notable moments like:<br />- Finishing <i>100 Years</i> on a boat with my family<br />- Reading book 7 of HP for the first time curled up in my childhood bedroom<br />- The end of <i>And the Mountains Echoed</i> on a ferry to Martha's Vineyard<br/>"

But I will try to list a few!<br />- so many fucking names<br />- absolutely ZERO character development<br />- bizarre pacing, esp during scenes that should have been intense, everything just felt... flat<br />- filler plot that accomplishes just about nothing<br />- infuriatingly repetitive conversations between main characters<br /><br />The only reason this gets 2 stars and not 1 is the hangover effect from the first book. I still like the world that was built and am desperate for more crumbs of information about it.<br /><br />Where were you when the era of dragon smut died?<br/>"
